This package is to simulate rolling dice!Dice can have various probabilities and sides.

One main way to use the functionality of this package is to create objects of the class "die", which can be rolled. 

example using the default arguments of sides 1 through 6 and equal probabilities:
fair_die <- die()

Then, you can roll any object of class "die", creating an object of class "roll":
fair_50rolls <- roll(fair_die,times=50)

You can summarize objects of class "die" or "roll":
fair50_sum <- summary(fair_50rolls)

Finally, you can visualize many rolls with the plot functionality, giving you a marplot of frequencies:

plot(fair_50rolls)
